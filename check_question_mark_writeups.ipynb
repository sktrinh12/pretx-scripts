The residue was purified by column chromatography on a silica gel column (0-100% MTBE/hexanes) 2.46 g product was obtained (not accurate, see NOTE) 2.79 g SM was collected (not completely dry assumely)  NOTE:  The reaction was not done after 24 h - actually, there was still roughly half of the product in the reaction based on HPLC.  The work-up was able to get rid of all the pyridine but no TsCl was removed.   The column was used MTBE becuase the SM and the product are only responsive to 220 nm. TsCl would go along with the first product which made it hard to completely collect the desired compound. (Later it found out TBDPS was also in it) Even less polar system could not prevent this from happening (PWE003-47.run First column (0-100%) separated SM and product, TsCl came out with product. This mixtues portion was carried to the second column with 0/50% solvent (PWE003-47-2ndRUN.run), still happens.)  The product was dried and taken to NMR, it was surprisingly messing, according to the HPLC, the TBDPS impurity was not removed from it.  3. The SM was collected and dried on the pump (for a little while), and it was treated with Tosyl chloride (2.06 g, 10.81 mmol) in DCM (17 mL) and Pyridine (5.2 mL, 64.29 mmol) again and the mixture was stirred at rt overnight again.     4. Step 2 was repeated and all the product was coverted to the product this time. (Even though this time pyridine was not completely removed, its due to the pH <span style='background-color: yellow; color: black;'>?</span>(only to 3~4 in the aqueous layer)) A more careful was run and TBDPS impurity was finally removed from the system. \n",

HPLC indicated the consumption of SM and the formation of a new peak.  The crude product was combined with FEL024-76 and worked up and purified together.  The reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature and quenched by adding 30 mL of saturated KF solution followed by 30 mL of water and 50 mL of EtOAc. The resulting mixture was stirred at rt for 2 hours. The mixture was filtered and the filter cake was washed with water and EtOAc. The filtrate was collected and the layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (50 mL x 2). The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. The crude mixture was further diluted with 30 mL of 1 M HCl solution followed by 30 mL of THF. The mixture was further stirred at rt overnight. LC-MS indicated the consumption of vinyl ether and the formation of methyl ketone. THF was removed under reduced pressure and the mixture was diluted with 30 mL of water followed by 30 mL of EtOAc. The pH of water layer was adjusted to 7-8 by adding sodium bicarbonate. The layers were separated and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (30 mL x 2). The combined organic layers were dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure.

After purification, the compound was collected and neutralized (09242024)    The fractions collected from prep HPLC was combined and rotovaped to remove as much MeCN as possible. The resulting aqueous solution was neutralized by NaHCO3 (to pH ~8) and extracted with DCM/MeOH (9:1) several times. The organic phase was combined, dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and the solvent was removed in vaccum.\n",

Not sure what the issue is. Intermediates have looked messy since the O-allylation reaction. Update-it is possible that the mixture is due to HCl in the chloroform, although I did filter the CDCl3 through sodium carbonate before use.
